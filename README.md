## Dataset Overview

- **Rows**: 2,900 | **Columns**: 8
- **Target**: `Personality` (Introvert / Extrovert)

### Features:

- `Time_spent_Alone` – Daily hours spent alone (0–11)
- `Stage_fear` – Presence of stage fright (Yes/No)
- `Social_event_attendance` – Social event frequency (0–10)
- `Going_outside` – Frequency of going outside (0–7)
- `Drained_after_socializing` – Feeling drained after socializing (Yes/No)
- `Friends_circle_size` – Number of close friends (0–15)
- `Post_frequency` – Social media post frequency (0–10)

> Includes missing values – good practice for preprocessing.
